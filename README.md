# Projects_in_p5.js

A repository containing my creations using the p5.js library.
You can check my Instagram @_evi.js https://www.instagram.com/__evi.js/ to see some of the results immediately.

To be able to use the code make sure you have a copy of p5.js in the same folder. Then just open the html file on your browser and enjoy.
To download p5.js with a first example of html file visit https://p5js.org/download/

All content is written by me, exeptions when it is clearly stated. (and the html files which are all similar to each other and have been based on the instructions that can be found on the get started page of p5 https://p5js.org/get-started/)

As any other person using p5.js I need to thank Daniel Shiffman for the tutorials and the great inspiration from his challenges.
