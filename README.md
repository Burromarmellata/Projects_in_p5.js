# Projects_in_p5.js

A repository containing my creations using the p5.js library.
You can check my Instagram @_evi.js https://www.instagram.com/__evi.js/ to see some of the results immediately.

All content is written by me, exeptions when it is clearly stated.

As any other person using p5.js I need to thank Daniel Shiffman for the tutorials and the gerat inspiration from his challenges.
